    <p>
      Lest anyone think me petty, please note that this list is based entirely on 
      objective analysis and rigorous observation. These individuals have committed 
      trespasses so egregious, they cannot be forgiven.

    <h2>My List of Nemeses</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Wil Wheaton</strong> – 
        <em>He betrayed me in 1995 by failing to attend a Star Trek convention, thus 
        shattering my dreams of meeting Wesley Crusher.</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Barry Kripke</strong> –
        <em>His constant ridicule of my work (and that speech impediment—“Hewo, Shewdon”) 
        does not amuse me.</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Leslie Winkle</strong> –
        <em>She dared to mock string theory <strong>and</strong> called me a “dumbass.” 
        Unforgivable!</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Brent Spiner</strong> –
        <em>He opened a signed, mint-condition Wesley Crusher action figure in front of me. 
        A betrayal of collectible integrity!</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Howard Wolowitz (Occasionally)</strong> – 
        <em>He’s not a real doctor. That is all.</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Steve Jobs (Posthumously)</strong> –
        <em>Overpriced Apple products. Need I say more?</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Billy Sparks</strong> –
        <em>My childhood bully from Texas who tormented me for years. Some scars never heal.</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mystery Slot</strong> –
        <em>A rotating “New Nemesis of the Week.” Because there’s always room on the 
        list for fresh offenses.</em>
      </li>
