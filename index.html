    <p>
      Beyond my formal credentials, I also possess a <strong>remarkable memory</strong> 
      (which I like to refer to as <em>eidetic</em>). I've authored several papers on 
      <strong>string theory</strong> (available upon request), regularly engage in 
      high-level physics symposiums, and conduct <strong>occasional lectures</strong> 
      that enthrall my colleagues. (Or so I'd like to think—some “lesser minds” find 
      my lectures <em>intimidating</em> rather than illuminating.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, I am proud to say that I've never missed 
      <strong>“Halo Night”</strong> since its inception, except in rare instances of 
      illness—though thanks to my immune system, even microbes tend to avoid me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many have asked if I <em>aspire to a Nobel Prize</em>. The short answer: “Does 
      the Earth revolve around the Sun?” (Yes, it does, and yes, I will get one.)

      You see that seat cushion? That is my spot. It’s located in the perfect position 
      relative to the television and cross-breeze of the window, minimizing both glare 
      and drafts. Visitors are strongly advised <strong>not</strong> to sit there under 
      any circumstances. You’ve been warned.

    <h2>Personal Tidbits</h2>
    <p>
      Despite my unparalleled intellect, some people find my social skills to be... 
      <em>challenging</em>. I maintain a series of highly specific <strong>Roommate Agreements</strong>, 
      much to my roommate Leonard’s dismay, and I adhere to a <strong>strict personal schedule</strong> 
      that includes a designated laundry night (Saturday at 8:15 PM) and a bedtime no later than 
      10:00 PM (except under extreme circumstances, such as live NASA broadcasts).
    </p>
    <p>
      Should you ever meet my mother, Mary Cooper, don’t mention evolution. She might take it 
      personally. And if I ever knock on your door, expect <em>at least</em> three knocks 
      followed by the repeated invocation of your name—this is <strong>non-negotiable</strong>.
